<h2>About Me</h2>
<p style="line-height: 1.5;">I'm Jules, an author, filmmaker, artist, and mathematician. As a mathematician, I'm fascinated by dimensional theory and quantum entanglement. As a creative, I'm always attempting to capture the magic and pure humanity of relationships and simple conversations in my work. As for hobbies, I love woodworking, playing piano and guitar, and sailing. There's nothing quite so freeing as gliding across the water and harnessing the wild and raw power of the wind.</p>
